### Added

**13 semantic checks:**

| code | level | what it catches |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| `undefined-receiver` | error | route references a receiver that doesn't exist |
| `bad-regex` | error | `match_re` / `matchers` regex fails to compile |
| `no-root-route` | error | no root `route` defined |
| `duplicate-receiver` | error | receiver name defined more than once |
| `undefined-time-interval` | error | `mute_time_intervals` / `active_time_intervals` references unknown interval |
| `inhibit-no-equal` | warn | inhibition without `equal` silences too broadly |
| `unreachable-route` | warn | catch-all hides subsequent sibling routes |
| `groupby-ellipsis` | warn | `...` mixed with explicit labels in `group_by` |
| `empty-receiver` | warn/info | receiver has no integration configured |
| `repeat-before-group` | warn | `repeat_interval` shorter than `group_interval` |
| `circular-inhibition` | warn | two inhibition rules that silence each other |
| `wait-exceeds-interval` | warn | `group_wait` longer than `group_interval` |
| `inhibit-same-match` | info | source and target match the same label value |
| `unused-receiver` | info | receiver defined but not used in any route |
| `useless-continue` | info | `continue:true` on the last sibling route |

**CLI:**
- Multiple files: `amlint check prod.yml staging.yml`
- Stdin: `cat alertmanager.yml | amlint check -`
- `--format json` for integrations
- `--strict` to treat WARN as failure

**Integrations:**
- Pre-commit hook via `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`
- GitHub Actions CI on Python 3.9–3.12
